Throughout the learning process, whenever faced with something new or challenging, I instinctively try to find answers on my own and validate them through hypotheses. This gradual development has shaped my learning style of 'learning by doing,' where I actively confront and solve problems, resulting in a strong sense of accomplishment. Consequently, this learning approach enables me to discern the underlying logic of unknown domains and think critically within those realms."
