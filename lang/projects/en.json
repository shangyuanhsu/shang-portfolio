It primarily utilizes computers as learning aids for students, assisting teachers in their instruction. Math Island presents mathematical concepts in interactive game formats and guides students through self-paced learning using a course map. Students challenge math tasks and progress through levels according to their abilities, allowing them to plan and manage their own learning, ultimately boosting confidence and interest. Teachers can closely monitor each student's learning status and progress through the learning process, providing individualized guidance and assistance to address any learning difficulties. In this project, I will need to understand the requirements from teachers or research students, design the interface and database accordingly, develop corresponding APIs, and then proceed with frontend development and API integration."
